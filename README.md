# FlightDetails

## Why this?
Developed for a uni project, this web application aims to allow the user to **search for and book flights** for previously selected travel destinations. When used in a component compound where other components send the selected travel destinations in a determined structure, this component processes those and adapts the UI accordingly and starts searching for flights in an instant.

The components are supposed to run in a **distributed runtime environment** (see [uni project website](https://mmt.inf.tu-dresden.de/Lehre/Wintersemester_18_19/KP/) for further information) which enables **multi-device scenarios**. This component was part of the scenario 'TravelPlanner' where complex trips with multiple destinations could be planned from start to finish.
